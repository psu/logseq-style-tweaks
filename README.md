## How to

## About

It should be fairly easy to figure out how to add your own tweaks if you download the plugin. You are also welcome to suggest new tweaks.

## Roadmap

- Figure out how to remove CSS when settings change - to be able to skip reload.
- Add parameters to each tweak: settings-config -> process automatically into CSS.
- Split tweaks config from settings config.
